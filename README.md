# WindowsSecurityAnalysis
This script analyzes Windows Security events within the past 24 hours (by default) or according to user selection. It correlates each Event ID with MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, displays details about suspicious services, privileged logons, and newly installed or modified services, and optionally constructs a process tree for 4688 events.
